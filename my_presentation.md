# Introduction

From the first Olympics which was hosted in Athens in 1896 to the Olympics in Rio in the year 2016, “Modern Olympics” has covered a long journey of 120 years. The extensive dataset of  19.8 MB gives me a chance to present how the event has progressed through time. The analysis will answer below points:

<p class="fragment">1.	Distribution of weight & weight </p>

<p class="fragment">2. Distribution of medal types</p>
